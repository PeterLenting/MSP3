# Chasing Jack Kerouac

## Introduction
This site is a simple, informative and fun page, build to let fans of Jack Kerouac’s novel On the Road inform each other about places from the book that can still be visited now.  Fans can add new locations, delete their posts, adjust them and of course read posts from other fans.

## UX

### What is it?
A clean, fast and well-arranged website, which gives the visitor more information about places from Jack Kerouac’s novel On the Road that can still be visited these days.  
The site is really simple in use: anyone can add a new destination and tell about their experience.

### Who is the target audience?
Anybody who likes Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road. It could be people who want to visit some location from the book, or have already done so. But also people who are just curieus what the places look like these days.

### Mock-ups
[Mock-up of the mobile version of the game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeterLenting/MSP3/master/static/images/mock-ups/mobile-mock-up.jpg).
[Mock-up of the desktop version of the game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeterLenting/second-milestone-project/master/images/mock-ups/desktop-mock-up-name-and-flag.jpg)

As you can see there are some small diferences between the mock-up and actual game. On desktop I moved the aside to the right of the game, because it makes more sence to keep the actual game on the prominent left side. Besides that small changes are made to the lay-out. The yellow colour is chosen because yellow is the most iconic colour in cycling. It is the colour of the leadersjersey in the Tour de France. The darkblue and the orange contrast nicely and give the game a cheerfull look.

### User stories
As a visitor, I want:
1.	To read about the places Jack Kerouac wrote about in On the Road in order to find information about the way the places look now.
2.	To be able to edit a post in order to make the information more complete.
3.	To be able to delete a post when there is something wrong with it.
4.	To write about my own experience in order to inform other people.
5. 	To enjoy myself.

## Features

### Existing features
**Home** – The home-page of the site. It shows the posts people have made. Under each post is a button which gives the option to edit and delete the post.

**About**  – The About-page tells the story of the site. Why did I make it and what is the purpose.

**Add a post** – This page contains a form which makes it possible for anyone to add a post. All fields are required to make every post really add information for other visitors. 

**Edit** –  This button sends the user to the page where he or she can update any post.

**Delete** – This buttons allows anyone to delete any post.

**Submit** – Allows the user to send in his form.

**Footer** - The footer shows links to the social media accounts of Chasing Jack Kerouac. The links are empty now, since there are no social-accounts yet.

### Features left to implement

1.	Add Photo’s
It would be nice for the user to be able to add a photo to their post. That way they can show what the place they visited, actually looked like at that moment. The photo would off course also be shown on the website.

2.	Log in
In the current condition of the webpage anyone can make changes to all the posts. Off course it would be really nice to give people the option to make an account and make them log in before they can write, update and delete their post.

3.	Search
By making it possible for users to search, they could just look at the places they are really interested in. In the future, when more posts are made, such a function would really add value to the site.

4.	Give likes or thumbs up
It would be nice if users where able to let other users know whether they like the post someone made. That way people would know their work was appreciated and other visitors would know which posts are most popular. 

5. 	Add social media accounts
The links in the footer to the social media accounts of Chasing Jack Kerouac are empty for know, since there are no accounts. These accounts could really add to the interaction of the community of Kerouac-fans and helps them share their post.

## Technologies used
•	HTML, CSS

•	IDE: Gitpod

•	[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the grid system of the page.

•	[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts.

•	[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons in the footer of the website.


•	Paint to edit the images used.

•	Google Chrome developer tools.

•	Bash / Ubuntu to commit my project and to push it to Github.

•	[Github](https://github.com/) for version control and for users to view the deployed version of the website.

## Testing

### Responsive testing
The responsiveness of the page was tested at all times during the development of the site. Locally as well as in preview using Google Inspect.

### Manual testing

I created, read, updated and deleted posts myself and had other people testing it as well during the development. This is a reliable way of discovering whether everything works as it should.


### Improvements after testing
•   Walking through the game the first time, I noticed it would be really easy to find the answer in Google Chrome developer tools or by rightclicking the image, if I had the name of the cyclist in the name of the image. So I decided to give every image a number instead.

•   A bug that came up in the end after I had made some adjustments to the rungame()-function was that the names of all the cyclists in the game were seen as correct on all images. This of course was not the way the game is intended. I fixed this by making indexOf() a Boolean by adding '> -1'.

•   It was possible to adjust 'Round' and 'Score' manually. This of course was not the intention and is fixed by making the input 'readonly'.

•   It turned out cyclist-14- empty.png was the same image as cyclist-14.png. This was of course changed, so cyclist-14-empty.png was indeed without the name and the nation of the cyclist.

### Browsers
The game was tested in Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox.

### Automated Testing
The following **validation services** were used to check the validity of the code:

•	W3C Markup Validation Service was used to validate HTML.

•	W3C CSS validation was used to validate CSS.

•	JSHint was used to validate JavaScript.

## Deployment
The project was built using Cloud9 and Visual Studio Code. I committed the project and pushed it up to Github using Bash.
During the development of the game, there were some issues with AWS / Cloud9. As one of the consequences it was required to push minor updates to github to make them visible for the Code Institute Tutors. This of course is not realistic for a project in real live, but does mean that some of the commits in the repository are only done for the tutors and would not have been done if this was a 'real' project.
